The industrial revolution has bought a lot of changes in the life of people. The manufacturing level has increased with the increase in time along with the <b>machine intelligence.</b> As artificial intelligence, as well as digital manufacturing, has increased and lead to publications like Atlantic to ask that if the machines can do all the work of the human, then what work will be done by them?
<br><br>
The answer to this is everything else, as the human need to collect the information about the machine they are working on so as to get the best work out of it. It is vital for humans to work on time along with the right context so as to get the best result.
<br><br>
<b>The digital Threat</b>
<br><br>
It is believed that manufacturing is considered a creative endeavor. When one adds the consumer demand element along with the design element it acts like art as well as music. All the manufacturers design different things that are used by people all day. It is because this will help in increasing the number of customers in less duration of time.
<br><br>
Today’s factories are making using the digital platform so as to increase the number of customers. It even adds the digital threat along with the process that looks like-
<br><br>
1) The designer tries and adds the digital twin within the software of CAD.<br>
2) Once the design is created, then it is checked and simulated. Like- UnderArmor simulates how fabrics will hang on a human model.<br>
3) After the design is created, then the plan is built and simulated. This detail helps in realizing the design.<br>
4) Once the design is finalized, then it is fabricated using various tools along with the processes.<br>
5) At the last step, the creation is been verified as well as modified.

<br><br>
<b>Intelligent Machining</b>
<br><br>
There was a time when tooled manufacturing was to be done by controlling the machines like the cutting of different devices or additive processes. At the end, one needs to make their decision on the digital sensor reading along with the analog. One should know that all the intelligent machines require complete data or computer algorithms. They are the mathematical expressions that are used in such operator activities so that the data can be collected easily. The intelligent machines carry the sensors that help in forming the closed loops in the system along with the manufacturing process. All the machines are designed in a different way so as to perform different tasks. The task may vary from cutting till 3d printing of the components. There are sensors that help in detecting the faults and help in controlling the function like-placing the component at the right place, then drilling and at last cutting. At different steps, different variations are detected and the process can even be adjusted for creating a better design. these involve the creation of unique data. The data needs to be found as well as used as finding different things requires a lot of intelligent searches.

One should even manage the relationship with their suppliers so that they can provide the goods on time. It comes to the history of the manufacturers; it states that nothing is perfect as the things might defect. All the things that are created by the manufacturer would undergo the revision as well as the modification so as to give it a fine look. The goods that are complete will end up coming to the customer in return. So, if one wishes to add the best quality product, then they need to link the component with the revision number. Then the numbers will get linked with the digital twin and they will get to know the plan or the process that is used for creating them.
